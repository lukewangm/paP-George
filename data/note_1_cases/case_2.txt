Prucalopride reduces the number of reflux episodes and improves subjective symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease: a case series

Introduction
Treatment of persistence to proton pump inhibitors or non-acid reflux episodes in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is challenging. Prucalopride, a selective high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist, might offer a possible new therapeutic alterative.

Case presentations
We report four chronically constipated female gastroesophageal reflux disease-patients with reflux symptoms and an increased number of reflux episodes in combined esophageal pH and multichannel impedance monitoring treated with prucalopride (2mg per day). Symptoms were persistent to proton pump inhibitors and ranitidine. Gastroesophageal reflux was detected by pH or multichannel impedance (MII) monitoring. Numbers of all reflux episodes as well as non-acid reflux episodes were reduced in all of our patients. The objective findings were concordant with subjective reports of symptom relief. There were no major adverse events in any patient during therapy with prucalopride.

Conclusion
Administration of prucalopride showed promising results in the treatment of persisting or weakly and/or non-acid reflux episodes in our case series in four constipated patients. Therefore, prucalopride can be regarded as a possible therapeutic option in the treatment of standard proton pump inhibitor-persistent reflux in the chronically constipated patient. However, further prospective trials are needed to prove our findings.
