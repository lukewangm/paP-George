"The Great Masquerader": An Interesting Case Series of Pulmonary Thromboembolism

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism are highly variable and non-specific. We report five cases of pulmonary embolism, each with a unique clinical profile and degree of severity. The clinical, electrocardiographic, and radiologic findings of each patient are described in this case series along with the appropriate therapy based on hemodynamic stability. It is crucial to distinguish between hemodynamically stable and unstable pulmonary embolism and treatment should be started right away to reduce morbidity and mortality secondary to obstructive shock.
