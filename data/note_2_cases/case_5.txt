Systemic lupus erythematosus associated with sickle-cell disease: a case report and literature review

Introduction
The occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus has been only rarely reported in patients with sickle-cell disease.

Case presentation
We describe the case of a 23-year-old North-African woman with sickle-cell disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, and discuss the pointers to the diagnosis of this combination of conditions and also present a review of literature. The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was delayed because our patientâ€™s symptoms were initially attributed to sickle-cell disease.

Conclusions
Physicians should be alerted to the possible association of sickle-cell disease and systemic lupus erythematosus so as not to delay correct diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment.
