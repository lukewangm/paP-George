      "1. Shortness of breath: The symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the right-sided\n",
      "chest pain could all be explained by a pulmonary embolus, and the CT shows\n",
      "evidence that confirms this diagnosis. Management should be to supply\n",
      "supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation, to control Mr.--’s\n",
      "chest pain, and to anticoagulate him. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight\n",
      "heparin and Coumadin could be started simultaneously, with both therapies\n",
      "should overlapping for at least five days; we will seek to obtain an INR between 2\n",

      "heart strain, so thrombolysis does not seem indicated at this time.\n",
      "With his history of long drives back and forth to California, Mr. -- is at risk for\n",
      "venous stasis, which is a major source of DVT’s; he even presents a history of\n",
      "lower leg pain and swelling. Testing for various causes of hypercoagulability\n",

      "antithrombin III, lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies, and factor V\n",
      "mutations, prothrombin mutation, lipoprotein a, and hyperhomocystinemia.\n",
      "Another important factor to consider would be malignancy, especially as Mr. --\n",
      "is a long-time smoker. Screening for lung, colon, and prostate cancer would be\n",
      "appropriate.\n",
      "2. Possible pneumonia: Mr. -- has a history of being febrile, and was diagnosed\n",
      "with pneumonia in Abilene (obtaining these records will be helpful), but does not\n",
      "currently have an elevated white count. The CT demonstrates an infiltrate,\n",
      "possibly consistent with pneumonia. Sputum cultures and blood cultures would\n",
      "be reasonable to obtain, though since he has been taking an antibiotic for\n",
      "presumed community acquired pneumonia, this may be low-yield. His vitals\n",
      "should be monitored regularly. It is possible that all pulmonary symptoms stem\n",
      "from the pulmonary embolus, but it would be reasonable to continue the antibiotic\n",

      "component.\n",
      "3. Anemia: Admission labs show hemoglobin at 11.5, with MCV of 89.5, so this\n",
      "anemia is normocytic. The patient denies any history of anemia when questioned,\n",
      "and was not dizzy, pale, or fatigued. He has had no history of acute blood loss\n",
      "other than the hemoptysis, which tends to be blood-tinged sputum rather than\n",
      "frank blood, and is not large in quantity. In order to work this up, we could obtain\n",

      "had a colonoscopy, so this should be certainly pursued in the outpatient setting.\n",
      "4. Smoking cessation: Mr. -- expressed interest in smoking cessation, and\n",
      "acknowledges that his respiratory symptoms make him feel less interested in\n",
      "smoking. I counseled him that this would be an excellent time to quit, as he will\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The pericardium is a fibroelastic sac made up of visceral and parietal layers separated by a (potential) space, the pericardial cavity. In healthy individuals, the pericardial cavity contains 15 to 50 mL of an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Pericardial diseases are relatively common in clinical practice and may have different presentations either as isolated disease or as a manifestation of a systemic disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the etiology is varied and complex, the pericardium has a relatively non-specific response to these different causes with inflammation of the pericardial layers and possible increased production of pericardial fluid. Chronic inflammation with fibrosis and calcification can lead to a rigid, usually thickened and calcified pericardium, with possible progression to pericardial constriction. In some cases, the clinical presentation of acute pericardial inflammation predominates, and the presence of excess pericardial fluid is clinically unimportant. In other cases, the effusion and its clinical consequences (ie, cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis) are of primary importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diseases of the pericardium present clinically in one of several ways [1,2]:\n",

      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Treatment of persistence to proton pump inhibitors or non-acid reflux episodes in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is challenging. Prucalopride, a selective high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist, might offer a possible new therapeutic alterative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case presentations\n",
      "We report four chronically constipated female gastroesophageal reflux disease-patients with reflux symptoms and an increased number of reflux episodes in combined esophageal pH and multichannel impedance monitoring treated with prucalopride (2mg per day). Symptoms were persistent to proton pump inhibitors and ranitidine. Gastroesophageal reflux was detected by pH or multichannel impedance (MII) monitoring. Numbers of all reflux episodes as well as non-acid reflux episodes were reduced in all of our patients. The objective findings were concordant with subjective reports of symptom relief. There were no major adverse events in any patient during therapy with prucalopride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Administration of prucalopride showed promising results in the treatment of persisting or weakly and/or non-acid reflux episodes in our case series in four constipated patients. Therefore, prucalopride can be regarded as a possible therapeutic option in the treatment of standard proton pump inhibitor-persistent reflux in the chronically constipated patient. However, further prospective trials are needed to prove our findings.\n",

      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Silent myocardial infarction relates to the absence of symptoms usually associated with myocardial ischemia. It has been estimated that silent myocardial infarction can occur in 2–4 % of young adult asymptomatic men. A majority of patients without an initially apparent cause of sudden death have been found at autopsy to have had significant coronary heart disease, including old, undetected myocardial infarction. Cases of sudden death in young men with unrecognized silent myocardial ischemia seem to be underreported, however.\n",

      "Case presentation\n",
      "A 35-year-old Norwegian man without a previous medical history died suddenly without preceding symptoms of coronary ischemia. Apart from elevated lactate, his laboratory test results were within normal limits. An autopsy revealed advanced coronary artery thrombosis of the left anterior descending branch with an extensive, partly organized myocardial infarction. The results of toxicological examinations of peripheral blood were negative for usual narcotics and alcohol.\n",

Among the many causes of collapsing glomerulopathy, autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, have been implicated.

Her collapsing glomerulopathy was initially well controlled following induction therapy with cyclosporine and prednisone and maintenance therapy with losartan. However, after developing adult-onset Still’s disease, she had multiple flare-ups despite various immunosuppressive therapies and developed worsening renal function, eventually progressing to end-stage renal disease.\n",

      "Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy also known as pachydermoperiostosis is a rare genetic disorder that has often been confused with acromegaly because of similar clinical features. Vascular endothelial growth factors which have been implicated in the clinical features of pachydermoperiostosis, have also been shown to be present in chronic hepatitis and implicated in the malignant transformation of hepatitis B infection to hepatocellular carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge there is one reported case of pachydermoperiostosis with chronic hepatitis B infection. We do not imply a causal relationship between pachydermoperiostosis and hepatitis B infection because pachydermoperiostosis is a genetic disorder; however, the question is raised whether hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is one of the many extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis B infection.\n",

      "A 21-year-old African (Ghanaian) man with chronic hepatitis B infection was referred to our Endocrine unit as having acromegaly with changing facial features, enlarging hands and feet, and large knee joint effusions which affected activities of daily living. He was finally diagnosed as having pachydermoperiostosis when acromegaly, rheumatological disorders, as well as cardiopulmonary disorders were ruled out. He improved with arthrocentesis, a tapering regime of steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and proton pump inhibitors.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "The present paper focuses on eponyms, that is, terms with proper names, in particular, derived from world mythologies, the Bible, and modern literature. The study highlights the significance of this terminological phenomenon in the English sublanguage of medicine and discusses its role in the process of writing medical case reports. The objectives of the research are to study the prevalence of eponyms in the English language in medical case reports and to analyze the etymology of the revealed terms. The deeper purpose of our study is to demonstrate that eponymic terms in general, and mythological and literary eponyms, in particular, are present in doctors’ spoken and written discourse far more extensively than might seem at first glance. By drawing attention to this terminological phenomenon, we will provide relevant guidelines, which will ensure the correct use of eponyms by medical professionals who will deal with the genre of medical case reports.\n",

      "We detected the major tendencies in using mythological and literary eponyms in medical case reports. We found a total of 81 mythological and literary eponyms, represented by 3995 cases of use in Journal of Medical Case Reports issues, and traced the etymology of their onomastic components. Hence, we delineated the five most prevalent sources of these terminological units: Greek mythology, Roman mythology, other world mythologies, the Bible, and fiction. The research revealed that modern medical case reports largely rely primarily on Greek mythology (65 eponyms, 3633 results), which is due to a rich informational and metaphorical arsenal of these ancient corpora of human knowledge. The group of eponyms rooted in Roman mythology ranks second, and these terms are much less prevalent in modern medical case reports (6 eponyms, 113 results). Four eponyms (88 results) represent other world mythologies (Germanic and Egyptian). Two terms with onomastic components come from the Bible (15 results), and four eponyms stem from modern literature (146 results). We also detected several widespread mistakes in the spelling of some mythological and literary eponyms. It is our opinion that the awareness of an eponym’s etymology can effectively prevent and minimize the appearance of such errors in medical case reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "The adequate use of mythological and literary eponyms in medical case reports is an effective way to share one’s clinical findings with colleagues from all over the world, because these eponyms are internationally widespread and understood. Correct use of eponyms promotes the continuity of medical knowledge and ensures conciseness and brevity, which are indispensable features of medical case reports as a genre. Therefore, it is highly important to draw students’ attention to the most prevalent mythological and literary eponyms, used in contemporary medical case reports, so they could use them appropriately, as well as with due awareness of the origin of these terms. The study also demonstrated that medicine and humanities are closely related and inherently interconnected areas. We believe that the study of this group of eponyms should be an integral component of doctors’ training and continuing professional education. This will ensure the interdisciplinary and synergic approach in modern medical education, which in turn will promote the all-round development of future healthcare specialists, endowed not only with professional expertise, but also with extensive background knowledge.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower respiratory tract infections are common in the general population, occurring with increased frequency in older individuals and those with chronic diseases or compromised immune function. An etiologic diagnosis can be made by culture of respiratory tract secretions, by isolation of a compatible organism from blood or pleural fluid cultures, or by molecular methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a positive blood or pleural fluid culture definitively identifies the pathogen, an organism growing from a respiratory specimen or detected by a molecular amplification method is not definitive proof that it is the etiologic agent. Many bacterial species are normal flora or colonizers of the respiratory tract and, although present in respiratory secretions, they may not be responsible for the clinical illness in an individual patient with pneumonia due to another cause. As a result, there is controversy about the diagnostic significance of many cultures or molecular results obtained from respiratory specimens. (See \"Clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing for community-acquired pneumonia in adults\" and \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults\" and \"Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia\".)\n",
      "\n",
      "A rational approach to specimen collection and the interpretation of results is required if clinically useful information is to be obtained [1]. The value and limitations of sputum cultures in patients with suspected bacterial pneumonia as well as the clinical indications for obtaining sputum cultures in such patients will be reviewed here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issues related to specimen transport to the laboratory, general approach to Gram stain and culture, and examples of clinical microbiology findings in patients with respiratory tract infections are discussed separately.

      "\n",
      "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the most severe clinical presentation of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which can be challenging to diagnose due to its non‐specific symptoms. The overlapping clinical symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and PE may make distinguishing between the two difficult. Thus, the diagnosis of PE may be delayed or missed, with grave consequences for the patient's outcome and safety. We herein present the case of a 63‐year‐old Iranian female admitted to our hospital showing symptoms of delirium superimposed on dementia. Soon after her admission, she developed a fever and respiratory symptoms. However, overestimating the likelihood of COVID‐19 pneumonia and attributing the patient's symptoms to this disease led to a delayed diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism, resulting in the patient's death. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, a high index of suspicion is required for the timely diagnosis of PE, especially in patients with identifiable risk factors. This is specifically true for older patients who cannot express their symptoms due to neurocognitive disorders.\n",

      "Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and sometimes fatal disease with a variable clinical presentation. It is critical that therapy be administered in a timely fashion [1-5].\n",

      "The approach to treatment outlined in this topic is, in general, consistent with strategies outlined by several international societies including the American College of Chest Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the European Society of Cardiology, the European Respiratory Society, the American Society of hematology, and others [6-10].\n",
      "\n",
      "INITIAL APPROACH AND RESUSCITATION\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial approach to patients with suspected PE should focus upon stabilizing the patient while clinical evaluation and definitive diagnostic testing are ongoing [11]. Anticoagulation should be initiated even prior to confirming the diagnosis of PE if risk benefit regarding suspicion of PE and risk of bleeding appear favorable. Once diagnosis is confirmed, risk stratification is crucial. It is also important to triage and risk stratify the patients to identify which patients may benefit from inter hospital transfer.\n",

      "Case summary\n",
      "We present a case of 62-year-old male who presented after experiencing syncope and cardiac arrest. Given the clinical presentation and electrocardiographic findings, there was concern for acute coronary syndrome. However, coronary angiogram did not reveal significant coronary obstruction. Due to the unclear nature of his presentation, a bedside echocardiogram was rapidly performed and was indicative of right ventricular strain. Due to these findings, a pulmonary angiogram was performed that revealed massive pulmonary embolism. He successfully underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis and, after a prolonged hospital stay, was discharged home on lifelong anticoagulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "The impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on the cardiovascular system has been prominent and multifaceted. COVID-19 can have wide-ranging effects on the cardiovascular system due to coagulopathy with resultant venous and arterial thrombo-embolism. Due to the critical condition of many patients affected by COVID-19, imaging for thrombo-embolic events is often delayed. With the use of bedside echocardiogram, observation of right ventricular strain may be critical in raising suspicion for pulmonary embolism, especially when atypical features are noted on electrocardiogram.\n",

    "3. Diabetes\n",
    "4. sleep apnea\n",
    "Assessment\n",
    "This is a 76 yo gentleman with PMH significant for HTN, DM, and sleep apnea who\n",
    "presented to the ED with 1 day history of intermittent chest pain.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis of chest pain\n",
    "1. MI\n",
    " Myocardial infarction occurs when blood supply to the myocardium via coronary\n",
    "arteries is interrupted resulting in ischemia. Risk factors for a MI are atherosclerosis,\n",
    "angina, previous MI or stroke, older age, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, HTN,\n",
    "obesity, etc. A patient that is having an acute myocardial infarction will typically present\n",
    "with substernal chest pain that may radiate to the shoulder, jaw, or arm as well as SOB,\n",
    "N/V, palpitations, and diaphoresis. On EKG there will be evidence of ST elevation or\n",
    "depression, Q waves, or inverted T waves. Cardiac enzymes such as troponin and CKMB will typically increase within 3-12 hours after onset of chest pain if the pt is having a\n",
    "MI. A series of 3 measurements of cardiac enzymes is usually performed in order to\n",
    "monitor for elevations over time. All pts who are suspected of having a MI should\n",
    "receive an aspirin as well as nitroglycerin, as was done in the case of ----.\n",
    " ----’s age, diabetes, and HTN put him at an increased risk for a myocardial infarction.\n",
    "His presentation isn’t typical for a MI since his pain is not substernal, there is no N/V, \n",
    "palpitations, sweating, or radiation of pain. His normal EKG and initial normal cardiac\n",
    "enzymes also make it less likely that ---- is currently having a MI. However, it would be\n",
    "ideal to perform another EKG tomorrow morning as well as repeat cardiac enzymes in 6-\n",
    "8 hours to make sure a MI will not be missed.\n",
    "2. Angina pectoris /Unstable Angina\n",
    " Angina is chest pain that results from decreased blood flow and ischemia of the\n",
    "myocardium. Pts typically feel pressure, heaviness, or tightness in the chest that is\n",
    "precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. Worsening angina, angina at rest, or angina\n",
    "that lasts more than 15 minutes are all typical signs of unstable angina. A patient with\n",
    "unstable angina does not have ST elevation or new Q waves on EKG and serum CK-MB\n",
    "and troponin are normal. Based upon this information it seems that it is very likely that\n",
    "SR may have unstable angina. His chest pain has not been precipitated by exertion (as\n",
    "with stable angina), but has come on with varying degrees of activity from rest (sitting in\n",
    "bed) to mild exertion (walking around house). Also, once SR was given nitroglycerin in\n",
    "the ED, he stated that his pain had receded somewhat. The only factor in his history that\n",
    "makes the diagnosis of unstable angina less likely is the fact that his chest pain lasts only\n",
    "2-3 minutes. Typically chest pain associated with unstable angina usually lasts more than\n",
    "20 minutes in duration. Once SR is stabilized and a myocardial infarction is ruled out he\n",
    "should undergo nuclear stress testing in order to evaluate him for unstable angina.\n",
    "3. Musculoskeletal pain\n",
    " Musculoskeletal chest pain must be differentiated from potentially life-threatening\n",
    "causes of chest pain such as MI, PE, or aortic dissection. Typically with musculoskeletal\n",
    "pain, the chest pain can be reproduced on physical exam with palpation or with various\n",
    "exercises of the arms and trunk. The patient may also have a history of strength training,\n",
    "yard work, or other exercises that may have strained the chest muscles. Pts with MSK\n",
    "chest pain may benefit from NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, or possibly narcotic analgesics.\n",
    "If all possible cardiac causes of chest pain can be ruled out in the case of ----, his pain\n",
    "will likely be attributed to musculoskeletal. He has a history of exercising at the gym and\n",
    "he also reported doing some yard work after the first episode of chest pain both of which\n",
    "may have lead to chest muscle strain. On physical exam the chest pain was elicited with\n",
    "palpation as well as deep inspiration which also supports a diagnosis of musculoskeletal\n",
    "pain. Therefore, pending negative cardiac enzymes X3, normal EKG X2, and normal\n",
    "nuclear stress test SR can be discharged with the strong suspicion that the source of his\n",
    "pain was muscular.\n",
    "4. Gastroesophageal reflux\n",
    " A patient with gastroesophageal reflux typically complains of a substernal burning\n",
    "sensation that is most commonly experienced after meals, can wake the patient from\n",
    "sleep, and is relieved with antacids. The chest pain may be described as a\n",
    "squeezing/burning that is located substernally, which may radiate to back, neck, jaw, or\n",
    "arms. Symptoms felt with reflux can thus often mimic angina. A patient with reflux may\n",
    "also experience regurgitation of the gastric contents producing a sour taste in the mouth.\n",
    "This confluence of symptoms does not correlate with what ---- stated that he was\n",
    "experiencing. His chest pain was not substernal nor was it squeezing/burning in nature.\n",
    "He also denied any regurgitation or that the pain was associated with meals. Therefore, I\n",
    "do not believe that ----’s symptoms are due to reflux/GERD.\n",
    "5. Pericarditis\n",
    " Pericarditis typically presents with chest pain (usually pleuritic), friction rub, and\n",
    "widespread ST segment elevation on EKG. The causes of pericarditis include viral,\n",
    "neoplasm, tuberculosis, prior mediastinal radiation exposure, s/p MI, cardiac surgery or\n",
    "trauma, collagen vascular disease, and drugs.\n",
    " Based upon this information, it does not seem likely that SM has pericarditis.\n",
    "Although he is experiencing chest pain, it does not seem to be pleuritic in nature. No\n",
    "friction rub was heard on physical exam and his EKG was normal. Therefore, a\n",
    "diagnosis of pericarditis is not concerning us at this time.\n",
    "6. pulmonary embolism\n",
    " Pulmonary embolism is a common and often fatal disease, but the mortality from a PE\n",
    "can be reduced with rapid diagnosis and therapy. A pulmonary embolism typically\n",
    "occurs when a blood clot from a DVT travels to a pulmonary artery (or one of its\n",
    "branches) and obstructs it. Less commonly it can occur from fat or bone (after trauma),\n",
    "air, or amniotic fluid (after childbirth). Risk factors for pulmonary embolism include\n",
    "immobilization, recent surgery, stroke, malignancy, chronic heart disease, and h/o venous\n",
    "thromboembolism. Typically a pulmonary embolism presents with dyspnea, pleuritic\n",
    "chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, rales, tachycardia, hypotension, S4, and fever.\n",
    "Routine lab findings include leukocytosis, increased ESR, and elevated serum LDH or\n",
    "AST with normal bilirubin, however these findings are all nonspecific for PE. BNP,\n",
    "troponin, and D-Dimer can also be elevated in PE, but elevations in these can also be\n",
    "seen with other disorders as well. The gold standard for diagnosing PE is pulmonary\n",
    "angiography, but spiral CT is increasing in popularity. If hypoxemia exists, the patient\n",
    "should be started on supplemental oxygen. If the patient is hypotensive then IV fluids\n",
    "should be administered. Anticoagulation should also be started as soon as a PE is\n",
    "suspected.\n",

    "Background\n",
    "Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy also known as pachydermoperiostosis is a rare genetic disorder that has often been confused with acromegaly because of similar clinical features. Vascular endothelial growth factors which have been implicated in the clinical features of pachydermoperiostosis, have also been shown to be present in chronic hepatitis and implicated in the malignant transformation of hepatitis B infection to hepatocellular carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge there is one reported case of pachydermoperiostosis with chronic hepatitis B infection. We do not imply a causal relationship between pachydermoperiostosis and hepatitis B infection because pachydermoperiostosis is a genetic disorder; however, the question is raised whether hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is one of the many extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis B infection.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the most severe clinical presentation of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which can be challenging to diagnose due to its non‐specific symptoms. The overlapping clinical symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and PE may make distinguishing between the two difficult. Thus, the diagnosis of PE may be delayed or missed, with grave consequences for the patient's outcome and safety. We herein present the case of a 63‐year‐old Iranian female admitted to our hospital showing symptoms of delirium superimposed on dementia. Soon after her admission, she developed a fever and respiratory symptoms. However, overestimating the likelihood of COVID‐19 pneumonia and attributing the patient's symptoms to this disease led to a delayed diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism, resulting in the patient's death. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, a high index of suspicion is required for the timely diagnosis of PE, especially in patients with identifiable risk factors. This is specifically true for older patients who cannot express their symptoms due to neurocognitive disorders.\n",

    "The pericardium is a fibroelastic sac made up of visceral and parietal layers separated by a (potential) space, the pericardial cavity. In healthy individuals, the pericardial cavity contains 15 to 50 mL of an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Pericardial diseases are relatively common in clinical practice and may have different presentations either as isolated disease or as a manifestation of a systemic disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the etiology is varied and complex, the pericardium has a relatively non-specific response to these different causes with inflammation of the pericardial layers and possible increased production of pericardial fluid. Chronic inflammation with fibrosis and calcification can lead to a rigid, usually thickened and calcified pericardium, with possible progression to pericardial constriction. In some cases, the clinical presentation of acute pericardial inflammation predominates, and the presence of excess pericardial fluid is clinically unimportant. In other cases, the effusion and its clinical consequences (ie, cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis) are of primary importance.\n",

Her collapsing glomerulopathy was initially well controlled following induction therapy with cyclosporine and prednisone and maintenance therapy with losartan.

    "Lower respiratory tract infections are common in the general population, occurring with increased frequency in older individuals and those with chronic diseases or compromised immune function. An etiologic diagnosis can be made by culture of respiratory tract secretions, by isolation of a compatible organism from blood or pleural fluid cultures, or by molecular methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a positive blood or pleural fluid culture definitively identifies the pathogen, an organism growing from a respiratory specimen or detected by a molecular amplification method is not definitive proof that it is the etiologic agent. Many bacterial species are normal flora or colonizers of the respiratory tract and, although present in respiratory secretions, they may not be responsible for the clinical illness in an individual patient with pneumonia due to another cause. As a result, there is controversy about the diagnostic significance of many cultures or molecular results obtained from respiratory specimens.

    "\n",
    "Background\n",
    "The present paper focuses on eponyms, that is, terms with proper names, in particular, derived from world mythologies, the Bible, and modern literature. The study highlights the significance of this terminological phenomenon in the English sublanguage of medicine and discusses its role in the process of writing medical case reports. The objectives of the research are to study the prevalence of eponyms in the English language in medical case reports and to analyze the etymology of the revealed terms. The deeper purpose of our study is to demonstrate that eponymic terms in general, and mythological and literary eponyms, in particular, are present in doctors’ spoken and written discourse far more extensively than might seem at first glance. By drawing attention to this terminological phenomenon, we will provide relevant guidelines, which will ensure the correct use of eponyms by medical professionals who will deal with the genre of medical case reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "We studied the prevalence of these terms in the issues of Journal of Medical Case Reports (2008–2022) and classified them according to their etymological origin and frequency of use. The selected medical case reports were considered using the methods of quantitative examination, and structural, etymological, and contextual analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "We detected the major tendencies in using mythological and literary eponyms in medical case reports. We found a total of 81 mythological and literary eponyms, represented by 3995 cases of use in Journal of Medical Case Reports issues, and traced the etymology of their onomastic components. Hence, we delineated the five most prevalent sources of these terminological units: Greek mythology, Roman mythology, other world mythologies, the Bible, and fiction. The research revealed that modern medical case reports largely rely primarily on Greek mythology (65 eponyms, 3633 results), which is due to a rich informational and metaphorical arsenal of these ancient corpora of human knowledge. The group of eponyms rooted in Roman mythology ranks second, and these terms are much less prevalent in modern medical case reports (6 eponyms, 113 results). Four eponyms (88 results) represent other world mythologies (Germanic and Egyptian). Two terms with onomastic components come from the Bible (15 results), and four eponyms stem from modern literature (146 results). We also detected several widespread mistakes in the spelling of some mythological and literary eponyms. It is our opinion that the awareness of an eponym’s etymology can effectively prevent and minimize the appearance of such errors in medical case reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "The adequate use of mythological and literary eponyms in medical case reports is an effective way to share one’s clinical findings with colleagues from all over the world, because these eponyms are internationally widespread and understood. Correct use of eponyms promotes the continuity of medical knowledge and ensures conciseness and brevity, which are indispensable features of medical case reports as a genre. Therefore, it is highly important to draw students’ attention to the most prevalent mythological and literary eponyms, used in contemporary medical case reports, so they could use them appropriately, as well as with due awareness of the origin of these terms. The study also demonstrated that medicine and humanities are closely related and inherently interconnected areas. We believe that the study of this group of eponyms should be an integral component of doctors’ training and continuing professional education. This will ensure the interdisciplinary and synergic approach in modern medical education, which in turn will promote the all-round development of future healthcare specialists, endowed not only with professional expertise, but also with extensive background knowledge.\n",

    "We present a case of 62-year-old male who presented after experiencing syncope and cardiac arrest. Given the clinical presentation and electrocardiographic findings, there was concern for acute coronary syndrome. However, coronary angiogram did not reveal significant coronary obstruction. Due to the unclear nature of his presentation, a bedside echocardiogram was rapidly performed and was indicative of right ventricular strain. Due to these findings, a pulmonary angiogram was performed that revealed massive pulmonary embolism. He successfully underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis and, after a prolonged hospital stay, was discharged home on lifelong anticoagulation.\n",

    "Discussion\n",
    "The impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on the cardiovascular system has been prominent and multifaceted. COVID-19 can have wide-ranging effects on the cardiovascular system due to coagulopathy with resultant venous and arterial thrombo-embolism. Due to the critical condition of many patients affected by COVID-19, imaging for thrombo-embolic events is often delayed. With the use of bedside echocardiogram, observation of right ventricular strain may be critical in raising suspicion for pulmonary embolism, especially when atypical features are noted on electrocardiogram.\n"
